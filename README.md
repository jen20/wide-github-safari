#Wide GitHub for Safari

This Safari extension makes Github repositories appear full-width, which can be useful if you're on a large-ish screen (or working on a .NET project where ENTERPRISE dictates that all projects must be prefixed with 100 namespaces).

I take no credit for the JavaScript involved, it's taken from [here](https://github.com/xthexder/wide-github), which is the same idea for Chrome and Greasemonkey.
